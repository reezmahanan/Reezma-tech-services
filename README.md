## üé® Customization

### Changing Colors

The color scheme is defined using CSS variables at the top of `Reezstyle.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary:  #0b4e8d;   /* Change primary color here */
    --accent:   #03c6fc;   /* Change accent color here */
    --dark:     #0f1218;   /* Change background color here */
    --light:    #f5f9ff;   /* Change text color here */
    --shadow:   rgba(3, 198, 252, 0.3); /* Change shadow color here */
    --gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--primary) 0%, var(--accent) 100%);
}
```

### Adding More Services

To add additional service cards, copy the following HTML structure inside the `.services-container` div:

```html
<div class="service-card">
    <div class="service-icon">
        <div class="icon icon-[your-icon-class]"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="service-content">
        <h3 class="service-title">Service Name</h3>
        <p class="service-desc">Description of your service goes here.</p>
        <ul class="features">
            <li class="feature-item">Feature One</li>
            <li class="feature-item">Feature Two</li>
            <li class="feature-item">Feature Three</li>
            <li class="feature-item">Feature Four</li>
        </ul>
        <a href="#" class="cta-btn">Learn More</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

Then add a corresponding icon class in the CSS:

```css
.icon-[your-icon-class]::before {
    content: 'üîß'; /* Replace with your emoji icon */
}
```
