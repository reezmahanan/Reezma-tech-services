### Color Scheme

The website uses CSS variables defined in `Reezstyle.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary: #8B0000;     /* Dark red */
    --accent: #DC143C;      /* Crimson */
    --dark: #0f1218;        /* Background */
    --light: #ffffff;       /* Text */
    --gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #8B0000 0%, #DC143C 100%);
}
```

### Adding Services

Edit the services section in `services.html` or modify the stats in `index.html` to customize content.

### Extending Admin Features

The admin dashboard is built with modular JavaScript functions:

```javascript
// Add new metrics to system monitoring
function updateSystemMetrics() {
    // Add your custom monitoring logic
}

// Create custom chart
function renderCustomChart() {
    const ctx = document.getElementById('chart-id');
    new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'line',
        data: { /* your data */ },
        options: { /* your options */ }
    });
}
```

### Sample Data Structure

```javascript
// User object
{
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    password: 'hashed_password',
    role: 'admin', // or 'user'
    status: 'Active',
    joined: '2026-01-15'
}

// Project object

    name: 'Project Name',
    client: 'Client Name',
    budget: 50000,
